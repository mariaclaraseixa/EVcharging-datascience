# Electric Vehicle Charging Station Analysis - Data Science Class Project
This project aims to conduct an exploratory and inferential analysis of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, using data science techniques to identify patterns, challenges, and opportunities for infrastructure expansion.

Objectives:
- Analyze the geographical distribution of charging stations.
- Examine correlations between location and usage.
- Identify areas with high potential for new station installations.
- Evaluate usage patterns (times, frequency, charging duration).
- Apply data visualization, statistical analysis, and basic machine learning techniques (if applicable).
